Project Title: Hospital Recommendation/Recommender System for Ondo State Nigeria

Background: Nigeria has a population of over 200 million people, with an average life expectancy of 54 years. The country has a poorly funded public healthcare system, which has led to an increase in the number of private hospitals in the country. This project aims to develop a Hospital Recommendation/Recommender System that will assist patients in finding the best hospital near them based on their location, the availability of consultants, disease diagnosis, symptoms, prescription, and other relevant factors.

Objectives:

• To create a data-driven Hospital Recommendation/Recommender System.

• To improve accessibility to healthcare for the general public.

• To provide patients with an easy-to-use platform for selecting the best hospitals around them.

• To make it easy for patients to find hospitals with available consultants and medical experts.

• To help patients make informed decisions on where to receive medical attention.

• To improve the overall quality of healthcare in Nigeria.

Methodology: The Hospital Recommendation/Recommender System will be developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Local Storage and database management system. The system will be designed to capture information on hospitals, including their location, services, availability of consultants, disease diagnosis, symptoms, prescription, and other relevant factors. The system will make use of Google Maps API for proximity and distance calculations. It will also use Font Awesome Icons for better UX and UI.

Deliverables:

• A fully functional Hospital Recommendation/Recommender System.

• A report on the design and implementation of the system.

• A user manual that outlines how to use the system.

Timeline:

• Week 1-2: Research and planning

• Week 3-4: Designing the user interface

• Week 5-6: Developing the system

• Week 7-8: Testing and debugging

• Week 9-10: Documentation and submission

Budget: The development of the Hospital Recommendation/Recommender System will not require any external funding. The system will be developed using open-source software, and there will be no need to pay for any licenses or subscriptions.

Conclusion: The Hospital Recommendation/Recommender System will be a valuable tool for patients in Nigeria. The system will improve accessibility to healthcare, make it easy for patients to find hospitals with available consultants and medical experts, and help patients make informed decisions on where to receive medical attention. The project will contribute to the overall improvement of healthcare in Nigeria.
